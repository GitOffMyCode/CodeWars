// Codewars - Character frequency
// Write a function that takes a string and returns the letter frequency count for the text. This count excludes numbers, spaces and all punctuation marks. Upper and lower case versions of a character are equivalent and the result should all be in lowercase.
// The function should return a list of arrays sorted by the most frequent letters first. Letters with the same frequency are ordered alphabetically. For example: letterFrequency('aaAabb dddDD hhcc') -> [['d',5], ['a',4], ['b',2], ['c',2], ['h',2]]

function characterFrequency(text) {
    return text;
}

console.log(characterFrequency("hello"))

module.exports = characterFrequency;
