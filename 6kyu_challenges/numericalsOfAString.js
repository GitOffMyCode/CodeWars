// Codewars - Numericals of a String
// For each symbol in the string if it's the first character occurence, replace it with a '1', else replace it with the amount of times you've already seen it. There might be some non-ascii characters in the string.
// "Hello, World!" -> "1112111121311"
// "aaaaaaaaaaaa" -> "123456789101112"
